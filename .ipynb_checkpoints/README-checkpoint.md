# AML-Project
Due Date: Dec. 12, 2023

Milestone 1: Nov. 7, 2023

Steps to complete before first milestone:
> 1. Decide on a dataset
> 2. Gather data (How much data?)
> 3. 3-5 pages of progress report
> 4. Begin cleaning up data


**Skeleton Plan:**
> 1. Web crawl Goodreads, extracting book descriptions, authors, book titles, popularilty (number of ratings)
> 2. Cleaning up data, specifically focusing on NLP cleaning techniques on book description
> 3. Model Selection:
>> a. Latent Semantic Analysis or Latent Dirichlet Analysis (Clustering technique). Both techniques take the same input, so we will be trying both
> 4. May potentially need to preprocess data dependent on model selection
> 5. Hyperparameter Search (selecting number of clusters)
> 6. Training & Validating & Finetuning model
> 7. Retain clusters & manually label cluster based on top picked attributes
> 8. Use outputted clusters and labels as input into


**TO DO:**
> 1. Sign up for GitHub student  
> 2. Research LDA + LSA
> 3. Look into github for webscraping code
> 4. Researching pushing Jupyter notebooks onto Github
