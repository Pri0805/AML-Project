The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578861i/67896.jpg", "genres": ["China", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Spirituality", "Religion", "Taoism", "Eastern Philosophy", "Self Help", "Classics", "Poetry"], "asin": "0679724346", "isbn": "0679724346", "isbn13": "9780679724346", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["Toinette Lippe", "James Legge", "Jacob Needleman", "Mikhail Nikolenko", "Claudio Lamparelli", "Vladimir Antonov", "Gia-Fu Feng", "Brian Browne Walker", "Jane English", "Lao Tzu"], "publishDate": 620290800000, "ratingHistogram": [2476, 4997, 19865, 42064, 82511], "ratingsCount": 151913, "reviewsCount": 7105, "numPages": 107, "language": "English"}

As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1647270090i/1166599.jpg", "genres": ["Epic", "Magic", "Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Adult", "High Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy"], "asin": "0765302306", "isbn": "0765302306", "isbn13": "9780765302304", "publisher": "Tor Books", "series": ["The Wheel of Time"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson", "Robert Jordan"], "publishDate": 1256626800000, "characters": ["Rand al'Thor", "Nynaeve al'Meara", "Matrim Cauthon", "Aviendha", "Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag", "Egwene al'Vere", "Perrin Aybara", "Siuan Sanche", "Faile Bashere", "Elayne Trakand", "Min Farshaw", "Al'Lan Mandragoran"], "ratingHistogram": [1476, 2821, 14121, 48290, 88853], "ratingsCount": 155561, "reviewsCount": 4864, "numPages": 824, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "David Gemmell Legend Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Best Fantasy Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1230796800000, "category": "Fantasy", "hasWon": null}]}

Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews, Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege, the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl, Hadassah, and Marcus, the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant\u2019s family. Brought to Rome, she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings, but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone, she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless, impulsive, and villainous, Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia\u2019s brother, Marcus, is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life, but also the gap between Hadassah\u2019s unrelenting faith and Marcus\u2019 lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously, Atretes, a captured soldier from Germania, is forced to become a gladiator.

Author Kyle Keyes uses characters from two previous novels, to promote a theory that particle energy formats with a quantum root system, that can bypass time and space. Keyes believes that such fiction could turn to fact as we move into the age of quantum mechanics. Adventure fans everywhere should delight in this fast paced action story, that brings yesterday's gun play back to settle cyber-age injustice. Synopsis: Jesse Joe Jacks was born sometime during the snow blizzard of 1923. The Lower Elk County, game warden died from a lightning strike on July 23, 1959, while wearing a sheriff's star. Olan Chapman came to life in August of 1974 and found a computer career with a center city, electronics firm. Chapman drinks heavy and is haunted by flashbacks of an older sister, lost to an unsolved case of gang rape and murder. Jacks loved nature and lived to protect wildlife. He stood tall and fought to uphold justice. Jacks was also a crack shot with a firearm - any firearm. Chapman attends the theatre, plays piano and at one time led a march against the National Rifle Association. Both men have the same fingerprints, much to the chagrin of Lt General Alexis Grumman who heads the federal department for para-normal activities.

The authors of the bestselling Prediction Machines describe what you can do to prepare.Banking and finance, pharmaceuticals, automotive, medical technology, retail. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made its way into many industries around the world. But the truth is, it has just begun its odyssey toward cheaper, better, and faster predictions to drive strategic business decisions--powering and accelerating business. When prediction is taken to the max, industries transform. The disruption that comes with such transformation is yet to be felt--but it is coming.How do businesses prepare? In their bestselling first book, Prediction Machines, eminent economists Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb explained the simple yet game-changing economics of AI. Now, in Power and Prediction, they go further to reveal AI as a prediction technology directly impacting decision-making and to teach businesses how to identify disruptive opportunities and threats resulting from AI. Their exhaustive study of new developments in artificial intelligence and the past history of how technologies have disrupted industries highlights the striking phase we are now in: after witnessing the power of this new technology and before its widespread adoption--what they call \"the Between Times.\" While there continue to be important opportunities for businesses, there are also threats of disruption. As prediction machines improve, old ways of doing things will be upended. Also, the process by which AI filters into the many systems involved in application is very uneven. That process will have winners and losers.

In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.(jacket)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729686i/7905092.jpg", "genres": ["Family", "Literary Fiction", "The United States Of America", "Literature", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "American", "Adult Fiction", "Novels"], "asin": "0374158460", "isbn": "0374158460", "isbn13": "9780374158460", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "author": ["Jonathan Franzen"], "publishDate": 1283238000000, "characters": ["Patty Berglund", "Walter Berglund", "Richard Katz", "Jessica Berglund", "Joey Berglund"], "ratingHistogram": [7034, 13753, 36284, 61298, 48109], "ratingsCount": 166478, "reviewsCount": 14682, "numPages": 562, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Warwick Prize for Writing", "awardedAt": 1357027200000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Bad Sex in Fiction Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "John Gardner Book Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Favorite Book and for Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

After four harrowing years fighting on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns home to take a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day's journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season and shore leaves are granted every other year at best, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby. Tom, whose records as a lighthouse keeper are meticulous and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel has taken the tiny baby to her breast. Against Tom's judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them. M. L.

Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482i/11084145.jpg", "genres": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "History", "Technology", "Audiobook", "Leadership", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "asin": "1451648537", "isbn": "1451648537", "isbn13": "9781451648539", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "author": ["Walter Isaacson"], "publishDate": 1319439600000, "characters": ["Steve Jobs"], "places": ["San Francisco Bay Area, California"], "ratingHistogram": [45369, 44483, 160518, 383358, 581138], "ratingsCount": 1214866, "reviewsCount": 21203, "numPages": 630, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Financial Times Business Book of the Year", "awardedAt": 1325404800000, "category": "Shortlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "History & Biography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Know Square", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor\u2019s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna\u2019s twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race\u2014and the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place, bringing us one of the most powerful, dramatic, and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327934717i/18749.jpg", "genres": ["War", "Nigeria", "Literary Fiction", "Historical", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Africa", "Historical Fiction", "African Literature", "Novels"], "asin": "1400044162", "isbn": "1400044162", "isbn13": "9781400044160", "publisher": "Knopf", "author": ["Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie"], "publishDate": 1158044400000, "characters": ["Ugwu", "Kainene", "Richard", "Odenigbo", "Olanna"], "places": ["Kano", "Nigeria", "Nsukka", "Abba, Imo", "Umuahia", "Port Harcourt", "West Africa", "Biafra", "Africa", "Lagos", "Orlu"], "ratingHistogram": [1075, 2804, 15666, 57606, 75331], "ratingsCount": 152482, "reviewsCount": 11997, "numPages": 433, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Orange Prize", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "James Tait Black Memorial Prize", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Anisfield-Wolf Book Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN Open Book Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Hurston/Wright Legacy Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together--and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past--even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1654573897i/34002132.jpg", "genres": ["Epic", "Magic", "Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Adult", "High Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy"], "asin": "076532637X", "isbn": "076532637X", "isbn13": "9780765326379", "publisher": "Tor Books", "series": ["The Stormlight Archive", "The Cosmere"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"], "publishDate": 1510646400000, "characters": ["Lift", "Dalinar Kholin", "Kaladin Stormblessed", "Shallan Davar", "Adolin Kholin", "Hoid"], "ratingHistogram": [1000, 2261, 11959, 50703, 156464], "ratingsCount": 222387, "reviewsCount": 13824, "numPages": 1243, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "David Gemmell Legend Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Best Fantasy Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "David Gemmell Ravenheart Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Best Fantasy Cover Art", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Fantasy", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "BookNest Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Best Traditionally Published Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

He wishes he were like his clothes, untouched by external forces.\u201d Family man Nick Blake is living in New York City and working for the United Nations. Born and raised in the United States with broad knowledge of the Afghan culture, he is living the All-American life with his wife, Lisa, and their children. His life is turned upside down when, while on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan, Nick is kidnapped and finds himself in the clutches of the Taliban. Omar Farhad\u2019s debut novel Honor and Polygamy follows Nick throughout his eighteen months in Afghanistan and the devastating and unexpected turns his life takes, as he learns the true meanings of home, history and culture. After being held captive for several months, Nick is forced to marry the sixteen-year-old Shaista. Although he cannot forget his beloved wife and children back home, he finds himself falling in love with his second wife and, overwhelmed with guilt, is torn between his old life and his new one. Honor and Polygamy is far from simply a captivating fiction story, but is also a brilliant commentary on the United States\u2019 situation with Afghanistan. Farhad expresses his views on both the political and the cultural sides of Afghanistan. Politically, he is predicting how he feels the war will ultimately end, while culturally, he shows readers not familiar with Afghanistan that the 35-year-old war has created a population, which is uneducated, disloyal, and without identity. The United States and many other nations have continuously disrupted Afghanistan with no clear political objectives, and, in his novel, Farhad explores the consequences of these actions. The story of Nick Blake represents the reality of the Afghan culture and the results and disappointments of the political realities in Afghanistan, and shows readers just how unaware we all are of other cultures. Written by an author who has lived both the American and Afghan ways of life, Honor and Polygamy is a harrowing, haunting and deeply moving tale for our times.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400872547i/22242097.jpg", "genres": ["Polygamy", "Contemporary", "Politics", "Fiction"], "asin": "1491732954", "isbn": "1491732954", "isbn13": "9781491732953", "publisher": "iUniverse", "author": ["Omar Farhad"], "publishDate": 1399532400000, "ratingHistogram": [9, 8, 11, 38, 94], "ratingsCount": 160, "reviewsCount": 35, "numPages": 132, "language": "English"}

But while their friendship has been the subject of both scrutiny and admiration, few know the full story. Taking office at the height of the 2008 global recession, Obama was keenly aware of the fractured relationship between the US and Europe. And for her part, Merkel was suspicious of the charismatic newcomer who had captivated her country. Faced with the challenges of globalization, the two often clashed over policy, but\u2014as the first Black president and first female chancellor\u2014they shared a belief that democracy could uplift the world. United by this conviction, they would forge a complicated but inspiring partnership. Dear Barack is a thoroughly researched document of the parallel trajectories that led to Obama and Merkel meeting on the world stage and the trials, both personal and political, that they confronted in office. At times in the leaders\u2019 own words, the book details such events as Merkel\u2019s historic acceptance of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and the 2013 NSA spying scandal, demonstrating the highs and lows of this extraordinary alliance. A story of camaraderie at a global scale, Dear Barack shows that it is possible for political adversaries to establish bonds of respect\u2014and even friendship\u2014in the service of the free world.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1634401413i/58480569.jpg", "genres": ["Inspirational", "Nonfiction", "How To", "History", "Education", "Politics", "Germany", "Book Club", "Biography"], "asin": "1633310574", "isbn": "1633310574", "isbn13": "9781633310575", "publisher": "Disruption Books", "author": ["Claudia   Clark"], "publishDate": 1634626800000, "ratingHistogram": [111, 242, 333, 2737, 2932], "ratingsCount": 6355, "reviewsCount": 387, "numPages": 350, "language": "English"}

Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327997342i/318431.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "South Africa", "Race", "History", "Politics", "Africa", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "asin": "0316548189", "isbn": "0316548189", "isbn13": "9780316548182", "publisher": "Back Bay Books", "series": ["Long Walk to Freedom"], "author": ["Nelson Mandela"], "publishDate": 812530800000, "characters": ["Nelson Mandela"], "ratingHistogram": [1456, 1983, 8902, 26366, 46170], "ratingsCount": 84877, "reviewsCount": 4761, "numPages": 656, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Alan Paton Award", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts\u2014from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.

Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life\u2014having nothing but his own wits to help him along. Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (\"Love -- Rape -- Revenge!\"), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation \u2014and a startling, provocative debut.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347754998i/1768603.jpg", "genres": ["Crime", "Indian Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Contemporary", "India", "Fiction", "Book Club", "Novels", "Asia"], "asin": "1416562591", "isbn": "1416562591", "isbn13": "9781416562597", "publisher": "Free Press", "author": ["Aravind Adiga"], "publishDate": 1199174400000, "characters": ["Ashok", "Kusum", "Balram Halwai", "Kishan", "Stork"], "places": ["Laxmangarh", "Delhi", "Bihar", "South Asia", "New Delhi", "India"], "ratingHistogram": [4053, 12866, 50122, 78083, 43322], "ratingsCount": 188446, "reviewsCount": 12595, "numPages": 276, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/Robert W.

Maternal instinct knows no boundaries, including the nano-neural-net intravenously installed in Dannia Weston's mind to repress her identity, allowing her to perform a mission 300 years before her time. Transported to the year 1954, Dannia becomes a woman with a mid-twentieth century persona, college educated with an aptitude for mechanical invention. Due to her work during the war, she is employed by the U.S. government on a secret project. But what no one knows-including Dannia or those who sent her back to tinker with the mechanical past to reduce future pollution-is what might happen should she become emotionally involved in 1954. The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question. When Dannia falls in love with Peter Hersh and becomes pregnant, her hormones erode a small section of the nano-chained network that stabilizes her new identity, triggering a mild memory rebirth...and threatening her mission and the fate of the world.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444879956i/27111181.jpg", "genres": ["Time Travel", "Science Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Space", "Space Opera", "Speculative Fiction", "Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Novels"], "asin": "1478756225", "isbn": "1478756225", "isbn13": "9781478756224", "publisher": "Outskirts Press", "author": ["Gabriel F.W.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories - called eventyrs, or \"fantastic tales\" - express themes that transcend age and nationality.During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature listeners/readers as well. They have inspired motion pictures, plays, ballets, and animated films.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385233181i/46306.jpg", "genres": ["Childrens", "Short Stories", "Mythology", "Folklore", "Literature", "Fantasy", "Danish", "Fairy Tales", "Fiction", "Classics"], "asin": "0517092913", "isbn": "0517092913", "isbn13": "9780517092910", "publisher": "Gramercy Books", "author": ["Lily Owens", "Hans Christian Andersen"], "publishDate": 820483200000, "ratingHistogram": [797, 2403, 15917, 33834, 53680], "ratingsCount": 106631, "reviewsCount": 752, "numPages": 803, "language": "English"}

Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 and featuring a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.It relates the events experienced by a mariner who has returned from a long sea voyage. The Mariner stops a man on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience, fear, and fascination as the Mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: for example, the use of narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, or the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood each different part of the poem.\n  Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n (1772\u20131834) was an English poet, critic and philosopher who was, along with his friend William Wordsworth, one of the founders of the Romantic Movement in England, and one of the Lake Poets.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells\u2014taken without her knowledge\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \u201cimmortal\u201d human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\u2019d weigh more than 50 million metric tons\u2014as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\u2019s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \u201ccolored\u201d ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\u2019s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia \u2014 a land of wooden quarters for enslaved people, faith healings, and voodoo \u2014 to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta\u2019s family did not learn of her \u201cimmortality\u201d until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family \u2014 past and present \u2014 is inextricably connected to the history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\u2014especially Henrietta\u2019s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\u2019s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\u2019t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878144i/6493208.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Science", "History", "Medicine", "Medical", "Historical", "Audiobook", "Book Club", "Biography"], "asin": "1400052173", "isbn": "1400052173", "isbn13": "9781400052172", "publisher": "Crown Publishing Group", "author": ["Rebecca Skloot"], "publishDate": 1265097600000, "characters": ["Henrietta Lacks"], "places": ["Clover, Virginia", "Baltimore, Maryland"], "ratingHistogram": [19342, 28670, 109137, 253914, 301544], "ratingsCount": 712607, "reviewsCount": 39985, "numPages": 370, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Ambassador Book Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "American Studies", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Wellcome Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Puddly Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": " Nonfiction and Debut Author and Nominee for Favorite Book", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "AAAS/Subaru SB&F Prize for Excellence in Science Books", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Young Adult Science Book", "hasWon": null}]}

Usually, this signals frustration, that the discussion has reached a dead end, that you haven\u2019t made your point, and may even leave you feeling that your relationship with the other person has changed for the worse. Digital interactions, devoid of nuance and understanding, further complicate discussion. We may believe that we are superior because our opinions are the \u201cright\u201d ones, and in the future avoid conversations with those whose opinions differ from ours, sending us into a never-ending echo chamber. In I\u2019m Just Saying, author Milan Kordestani shows us that although challenging conversations can be unpleasant, they can also help us grow. Sometimes, people inspire us to change how we speak, making us better communicators in the process as we search to find common ground with those with whom we disagree. Kordestani uses contemporary case studies and personal experience to teach readers how to have constructive conversations by engaging in civil discourse\u2014the idea that good-faith actors can reach consensus on any opinion-based disagreement. He discusses influential leaders and reflects on his successes and failures in creating The Doe, an online publication focused on civil discourse. He addresses the challenges that digital media consumption presents when seeking common ground\u2014especially when people are only digitally connected. Civil discourse, an essential part of democracy, is becoming rare in today's digital age. I\u2019m Just Saying examines discourse's successes and the ways to rebuild it. Drawing from history, popular culture, and personal anecdotes, the book promotes effective civil discourse by providing practical advice and strategies for respect.

Looking back on the hardships of his early life, where difficult days are faced with courage but the valleys swell with the sound of Welsh voices, it becomes clear that there is nowhere so green as the landscape of his own memory. An immediate bestseller on publication in 1939, How Green Was My Valley quickly became one of the best-loved novels of the twentieth century. Poetic and nostalgic, it is an elegy to a lost world.Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd (1906-1983), better known by his pen name Richard Llewellyn, claimed to have been born in St David's, Pembrokeshire, Wales; after his death he was discovered to have been born of Welsh parents in Hendon, Middlesex. His famous first novel How Green Was My Valley (1939) was begun in St David's from a draft he had written in India, and was later adapted into an Oscar-winning film by director John Ford. None But the Lonely Heart, his second novel, was published in 1943, and subsequently made into a film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore.

It has often been called the quintessential novel of the 1980s.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542903489i/2666.jpg", "genres": ["Humor", "20th Century", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Contemporary", "New York", "Fiction", "American", "Classics", "Novels"], "publisher": "Dial Press Trade Paperback", "author": ["Tom Wolfe"], "publishDate": 1004428800000, "characters": ["Ferdinand Arguello", "John Campbell McCoy", "Peter Fallow", "St. John Thomas", "Jimmy Caughey", "Red Pitt", "Caroline Heftshank", "Mike Bellavita", "Greg Rosenwald", "Sherman McCoy", "Asher Herzfeld", "Brian Highridge", "Gil Archer", "Gloria Dawson", "Kate di Ducci", "Warren Bottomley", "Guliaggi", "Arthur Ruskin", "Annie Lamb", "Irv Stone", "Huck Thigg", "Lewis Sanderson", "Miss Lyons", "Alex Britt-Withers", "Bernard Levy", "Linwood Talley", "Eugene Lopwitz", "Nick Stopping", "Baron Hochswald"], "places": ["New York (State)", "New York City, New York"], "ratingHistogram": [1909, 4990, 17642, 30258, 24737], "ratingsCount": 79536, "reviewsCount": 3477, "numPages": 690, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Ambassador Book Award", "awardedAt": 568022400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 536486400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

This radiant translation by W.S. Kuniczak restores the original glory and richness of master storyteller Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic tale.Set at a turning point in history (A.D. 54-68), as Christianity replaces the era of corruption and immorality that marked Nero's Rome, Quo Vadis abounds with compelling characters, including:Vinicius, the proud centurion who has fallen deeply in love with a mysterious young woman who disappears the night they meet;Ligia, the elusive beauty. Vinicius will not easily win her love, for she is a Christian, one of the group of dedicated believers led by the apostle Peter. Christians are rare in pagan, hedonistic Rome, and suffer great persecution;Petronius, uncle to Vinicius, an elegant, witty courtier who scoffs at love and religion but finds his nephew's passion charming; andNero himself, enemy of all Christians, a despotic emperor who plunges Rome deeper and deeper into depravity. The decadence of his banquets is staggering; and even worse, his mad laughter is heard echoing in the amphitheater as gladiators duel to the death.As Nero's appalling plans for the Christians become ever clearer, time appears to be running out for the young lovers. Vinicius must come to understand the true meaning of Ligia's religion before it is too late.Grand in scope and ambition, Quo Vadis explores the themes of love, desire and profound moral courage. Lavish descriptions, vivid dialogue and brilliantly drawn characters make this one of the world's greatest epics. Beloved by children and adults the world over, Quo Vadis has been the subject of five films, two of them in English.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340709653i/538845.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Literature", "Polish Literature", "Religion", "Christian", "Historical", "School", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Classics"], "asin": "B00A2PBHVY", "isbn": "0781805503", "isbn13": "9780781805506", "publisher": "Hippocrene Books", "author": ["W.S.

Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. In Part One, \"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In \"Blind Willie\" and \"Why We're in Vietnam,\" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. And in \"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,\" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374048926i/11602.jpg", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Suspense", "War", "Supernatural", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Horror", "Historical Fiction", "Thriller"], "asin": "0340818670", "isbn": "0340818670", "isbn13": "9780340818671", "publisher": "New English Library", "author": ["Stephen King"], "publishDate": 978336000000, "characters": ["Bobby Garfield", "Ted Brautigan", "The Crimson King", "Peter Riley", "Ronnie Malenfant", "Liz Garfield", "Willie Shearman", "John Sullivan", "Carol Gerber", "American Law Enforcement"], "ratingHistogram": [1530, 6442, 24531, 33528, 27840], "ratingsCount": 93871, "reviewsCount": 2918, "numPages": 640, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "World Fantasy Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "Best Collection", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "British Fantasy Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "Best Collection", "hasWon": null}]}

Sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with very a special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one.Ph\u00e8dre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is courtesan, Ph\u00e8dre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundations of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further. And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a na\u00efve medical student \"possessed,\" as he wrote, \"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\" he wrote. \"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644i/25899336.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Philosophy", "Memoir", "Science", "Medicine", "Medical", "Audiobook", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "asin": "B00XSSYR50", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["Paul Kalanithi", "Abraham   Verghese"], "publishDate": 1452585600000, "ratingHistogram": [6968, 13408, 62493, 185437, 356923], "ratingsCount": 625229, "reviewsCount": 47770, "numPages": 208, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Biography or Autobiography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Wellcome Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1451635200000, "category": "Memoir & Autobiography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Waterstones Book of the Year", "awardedAt": 1451635200000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Prix Jan Michalski", "awardedAt": 1483257600000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Book of the Month Book of the Year Award", "awardedAt": 1451635200000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin\u2014a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths?

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385055753i/3462.jpg", "genres": ["Chick Lit", "Drama", "Contemporary Romance", "Love", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Adult", "Audiobook", "Adult Fiction", "Romance"], "asin": "0446696129", "isbn": "0446696129", "isbn13": "9780446696128", "publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "author": ["Nicholas Sparks"], "publishDate": 1112342400000, "characters": ["Taylor McAden", "Denise Holton"], "places": ["Edenton, North Carolina"], "ratingHistogram": [2114, 7359, 38469, 66679, 84203], "ratingsCount": 198824, "reviewsCount": 4936, "numPages": 339, "language": "English"}

Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:\u00b7 Prologue: The Illustrated Man \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Veldt [\u201cThe World the Children Made\u201d] \u00b7 ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 \u201950 \u00b7 Kaleidoscope \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct \u201949 \u00b7 The Other Foot \u00b7 ss New Story Magazine Mar \u201951 \u00b7 The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] \u00b7 ss Copy Spr \u201950 \u00b7 The Man \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb \u201949 \u00b7 The Long Rain [\u201cDeath-by-Rain\u201d] \u00b7 ss Planet Stories Sum \u201950 \u00b7 The Rocket Man \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Mar 1 \u201951 \u00b7 The Fire Balloons [\u201c\u2018In This Sign...\u2019\u201d] \u00b7 ss Imagination Apr \u201951 \u00b7 The Last Night of the World \u00b7 ss Esquire Feb \u201951 \u00b7 The Exiles [\u201cThe Mad Wizards of Mars\u201d] \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Sep 15 \u201949; F&amp;SF Win \u201950 \u00b7 No Particular Night or Morning \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Fox and the Forest [\u201cTo the Future\u201d] \u00b7 ss Colliers May 13 \u201950 \u00b7 The Visitor \u00b7 ss Startling Stories Nov \u201948 \u00b7 The Concrete Mixer \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr \u201949 \u00b7 Marionettes, Inc.

A self-declared \"light-skinned\" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in \"orchestrated chaos\" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. \"Mommy,\" a fiercely protective woman with \"dark eyes full of pep and fire,\" herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. \"God is the color of water,\" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401311300i/29209.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Race", "School", "Audiobook", "African American", "Book Club", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "asin": "1573225789", "isbn": "1573225789", "isbn13": "9781573225786", "publisher": "Riverhead Books", "author": ["James   McBride"], "publishDate": 854784000000, "ratingHistogram": [1883, 4185, 20226, 45503, 48222], "ratingsCount": 120019, "reviewsCount": 6720, "numPages": 291, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Anisfield-Wolf Book Award", "awardedAt": 852105600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Long Island Reads", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

Snyder did when he joined it;\u2022 German atrocities toward captured crew and civilians;\u2022 behind-the-scenes stories of the Belgium civilians who risked all to save American flyers who were in the air one moment, spiraling down in flames the next;\u2022 creation and dedication of the monument to the Susan Ruth and its crew located in Macquenoise, Belgium in 1989.Shot Down was created from the vast number of letters and journals of Howard Snyder; diaries of men and women on the ground who rescued, sheltered and hid the crew; and interviews conducted by historians. Centered around the 306th Bomb Group in Thurleigh, England, it is informative, insightful and captivating.For most, 70 years is a long time ago. World War II fades in importance as each year goes by.

But some among the Pilgrims were not pure of heart; they were not escaping religious persecution. Indeed, they were not even human. They were vampires.The vampires assimilated quickly into the New World. Rising to levels of enormous power, wealth, and influence, they were the celebrated blue bloods of American society. The Blue Bloods vowed that their immortal status would remain a closely guarded secret. And they kept that secret for centuries. But now, in New York City, the secret is seeping out. Schuyler Van Alen is a sophomore at a prestigious private school. She prefers baggy, vintage clothes instead of the Prada and pearls worn by her classmates, and she lives with her reclusive grandmother in a dilapated mansion. Schuyler is a loner...and happy that way. Suddenly, when she turns fifteen, there is a visible mosaic of blue veins on her arm.

A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, Gift from the Sea continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh\u2019s daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman.The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh\u2019s life.

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her \"head-for-the-hills bag\". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635i/35133922.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Religion", "Education", "Audiobook", "Adult", "Book Club", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["Tara Westover"], "publishDate": 1519113600000, "places": ["Provo, Utah", "Idaho", "Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Cambridge, England", "Boston, Massachusetts", "Arizona", "New York (State)", "Massachusetts"], "ratingHistogram": [12051, 23421, 112822, 410823, 858270], "ratingsCount": 1417387, "reviewsCount": 102747, "numPages": 352, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Best Female Narrator", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Biography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "ALA Alex Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Dayton Literary Peace Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Wellcome Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Longlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Autobiography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Memoir & Autobiography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Evans Handcart Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "PEN/Jean Stein Book Award", "awardedAt": 1546329600000, "category": "Shortlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Reading Women Award", "awardedAt": 1514793600000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.In The Namesake, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail \u2014 the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase \u2014 that opens whole worlds of emotion.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986i/33917.jpg", "genres": ["Indian Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Contemporary", "India", "Fiction", "Adult", "Book Club", "Adult Fiction", "Novels"], "asin": "0965141667", "isbn": "0618485228", "isbn13": "9780618485222", "publisher": "Mariner / Houghton Mifflin", "author": ["Jhumpa Lahiri"], "publishDate": 1041408000000, "characters": ["Ashima Ganguli", "Moushumi Mazoomdar", "Ashoke Ganguli", "Maxine", "Gogol/Nikhil Ganguli", "Sonia/Sonali Ganguli"], "places": ["Cambridge, Massachusetts"], "ratingHistogram": [2815, 11100, 54103, 109887, 87353], "ratingsCount": 265258, "reviewsCount": 14494, "numPages": 291, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Orange Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "Fiction Longlist", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a \u2018success\u2019 in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey\u2019s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven\u2019t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey\u2019s model, or anyone else\u2019s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey\u2019s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey\u2019s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421842784i/36072.jpg", "genres": ["Personal Development", "Business", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Productivity", "Psychology", "Audiobook", "Leadership", "Management", "Self Help"], "asin": "0743269519", "isbn": "0743269519", "isbn13": "9780743269513", "publisher": "Free Press", "author": ["Stephen R.

For omnivore like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma. When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffered by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore\u2019s dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What\u2019s at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children\u2019s health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.The Omnivore's Dilemma is groundbreaking book, in which one of America\u2019s most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire, how we answer it today, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic? Or perhaps something we hunt, gather, or grow ourselves? To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us\u2014industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves\u2014from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food-science laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even moral implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393804353i/3109.jpg", "genres": ["Environment", "Nonfiction", "Science", "Food", "History", "Nutrition", "Audiobook", "Politics", "Health", "Cooking"], "asin": "1594200823", "isbn": "1594200823", "isbn13": "9781594200823", "publisher": "The Penguin Press", "author": ["Michael Pollan"], "publishDate": 1144738800000, "ratingHistogram": [2774, 6228, 28897, 77567, 86563], "ratingsCount": 202029, "reviewsCount": 13999, "numPages": 450, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "California Book Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Nonfiction (Gold)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Orion Book Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man - or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home. Stretching from the Midwest at midcentury to the Wall Street and Eastern Europe of today, \"The Corrections\" brings an old-fashioned world of civic virtue and sexual inhibitions into violent collision with the era of home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and globalised greed.

Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication. In this classic autobiography, first published in 1903, Miss Keller recounts the first 22 years of her life, including the magical moment at the water pump when, recognizing the connection between the word \"water\" and the cold liquid flowing over her hand, she realized that objects had names. Subsequent experiences were equally noteworthy: her joy at eventually learning to speak, her friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett Hale and other notables, her education at Radcliffe (from which she graduated cum laude), and-underlying all-her extraordinary relationship with Miss Sullivan, who showed a remarkable genius for communicating with her eager and quick-to-learn pupil.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320429331i/821611.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "History", "Historical", "Audiobook", "Disability", "Autobiography", "Classics", "Biography"], "asin": "0553213873", "isbn": "0553213873", "isbn13": "9780553213874", "publisher": "Bantam Classics", "author": ["Helen Keller"], "publishDate": 641545200000, "characters": ["Anne Sullivan", "Helen Keller"], "places": ["Boston, Massachusetts", "Tuscumbia, Alabama", "Alabama"], "ratingHistogram": [3596, 6314, 26906, 47781, 61490], "ratingsCount": 146087, "reviewsCount": 3173, "numPages": 240, "language": "English"}

His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... For \"Garrett,\" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love.

On a cold March night New York Times reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or \"alienist.\" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.The newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before--and will kill again before the hunt is over.Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills.

Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion.

Outwardly she conforms to every stereotype of the concierge: fat, cantankerous, addicted to television. Yet, unbeknownst to her employers, Ren\u00e9e is a cultured autodidact who adores art, philosophy, music, and Japanese culture.

Yet the events Princip triggered were so monumental that his own story has been largely overlooked, his role garbled and motivations misrepresented.The Trigger puts this right, filling out as never before a figure who changed our world and whose legacy still has an impact on all of us today. Born a penniless backwoodsman, Princip\u2019s life changed when he trekked through Bosnia and Serbia to attend school. As he ventured across fault lines of faith, nationalism and empire, so tightly clustered in the Balkans, radicalisation slowly transformed him from a frail farm boy into history\u2019s most influential assassin.By retracing Princip\u2019s journey from his highland birthplace, through the mythical valleys of Bosnia to the fortress city of Belgrade and ultimately Sarajevo, Tim Butcher illuminates our understanding both of Princip and the places that shaped him. Tim uncovers details about Princip that have eluded historians for a century and draws on his own experience, as a war reporter in the Balkans in the 1990s, to face down ghosts of conflicts past and present.The Trigger is a rich and timely work that brings to life both the moment the world first went to war and an extraordinary region with a potent hold over history.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388535774i/18300212.jpg", "genres": ["War", "Nonfiction", "20th Century", "World War I", "Travel", "History", "Historical", "Politics", "European History", "Biography"], "asin": "070118793X", "isbn": "070118793X", "isbn13": "9780701187934", "publisher": "Grove Press", "author": ["Tim Butcher"], "publishDate": 1388563200000, "characters": ["Gavrilo Princip"], "ratingHistogram": [296, 303, 721, 1287, 1378], "ratingsCount": 3985, "reviewsCount": 285, "numPages": 352, "language": "English"}

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn\u2019t so bad\u2014at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d with his own \u201cHeil Puccini\u201d, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de Berni\u00e8res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Se\u00f1or Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island\u2014the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins\u2014would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Berni\u00e8res seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479680795i/3388.jpg", "genres": ["War", "World War II", "Greece", "Literature", "Classics", "Historical", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Romance", "Novels"], "asin": "067976397X", "isbn": "067976397X", "isbn13": "9780679763970", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["Louis de Berni\u00e8res"], "publishDate": 809679600000, "characters": ["Antonio Corelli", "Pelagia", "Dr Iannis", "Mandras"], "places": ["Greece", "Kefalonia"], "ratingHistogram": [2063, 4667, 15871, 30668, 32328], "ratingsCount": 85597, "reviewsCount": 3372, "numPages": 437, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Commonwealth Writers' Prize", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "Best Book Overall", "hasWon": null}]}

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827i/1202.jpg", "genres": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Finance", "Science", "Psychology", "Politics", "Audiobook", "Sociology", "Economics", "Social Science"], "asin": "0061234001", "isbn": "0061234001", "isbn13": "9780061234002", "publisher": "William Morrow", "series": ["Freakonomics"], "author": ["Stephen J.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.In Veronika Decides to Die, Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348139939i/1431.jpg", "genres": ["Philosophy", "Drama", "Literature", "Classics", "Psychology", "Contemporary", "Mental Health", "Fiction", "Romance", "Novels"], "asin": "0061124265", "isbn": "0061124265", "isbn13": "9780061124266", "publisher": "Harper Perennial", "series": ["On the Seventh Day "], "author": ["Margaret Jull Costa", "Paulo Coelho"], "publishDate": 1149145200000, "characters": ["Dr. Igor", "Athena (Greek goddess)", "Zedka", "Veronika", "Eduard", "Boston \"Mari\" Maribu"], "places": ["Ljubljana"], "ratingHistogram": [8039, 19277, 55869, 72813, 59406], "ratingsCount": 215404, "reviewsCount": 10719, "numPages": 210, "language": "English"}

Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clich\u00e9s of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.It opens with these simple, resonant words: \"Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge.\" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams", "title": "John Adams", "titleComplete": "John Adams", "description": "The enthralling, often surprising story of John Adams, one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- \"the colossus of independence,\" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as \"out of his senses\"; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris \"interest\" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478144278i/2203.jpg", "genres": ["American Revolution", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "History", "Historical", "American History", "Politics", "Audiobook", "Presidents", "Biography"], "asin": "0743223136", "isbn": "0743223136", "isbn13": "9780743223133", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster Paperbacks", "author": ["David McCullough"], "publishDate": 990514800000, "characters": ["George Washington", "Abigail Adams", "Benjamin Franklin", "John Adams", "Thomas Jefferson", "John Dickinson"], "places": ["Boston, Massachusetts", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"], "ratingHistogram": [19662, 17627, 47335, 105435, 166706], "ratingsCount": 356765, "reviewsCount": 7099, "numPages": 751, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 1009872000000, "category": "Biography or Autobiography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Ambassador Book Award", "awardedAt": 1009872000000, "category": "Biography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1009872000000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Puddly Award", "awardedAt": 1009872000000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "American Revolution Round Table Award", "awardedAt": 978336000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award", "awardedAt": 1009872000000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

Their life is, to say the least, unconventional. Frank's mother abandoned them years ago: his elder brother Eric is confined to a psychiatric hospital; and his father measures out his eccentricities on an imperial scale. Frank has turned to strange acts of violence to vent his frustrations. In the bizarre daily rituals there is some solace. But when news comes of Eric's escape from the hospital Frank has to prepare the ground for his brother's inevitable return - an event that explodes the mysteries of the past and changes Frank utterly.The Wasp Factory is a work of horrifying compulsion: horrifying, because it enters a mind whose realities are not our own, whose values of life and death are alien to our society; compulsive, because the humour and compassion of that mind reach out to us all.

Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie\u2014magical, comforting, wise beyond her years\u2014promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit\u2019s fortunes:Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.

Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work.

However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley\u2019s original expedition \u2014 but travelling alone.Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo\u2019s eastern border. He passed through once thriving cities of this country and saw the marks left behind by years of abuse and misrule. Almost, 2,500 harrowing miles later, he reached the Atlantic Ocean, a thinner and a wiser man.Butcher\u2019s journey was a remarkable feat.

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12996.Othello", "title": "Othello", "titleComplete": "Othello", "description": "In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine\u2014differences of race, of age, of cultural background\u2014that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination\u2014which dominates the early acts of the play\u2014turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105i/12996.jpg", "genres": ["Drama", "Tragedy", "Literature", "Read For School", "School", "Theatre", "Fiction", "Classics", "Poetry", "Plays"], "asin": "B006U1QW78", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "author": ["Barbara A.

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of \"the African\"\u2014Kunta Kinte\u2014but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him\u2014slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects\u2014and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936i/546018.jpg", "genres": ["Race", "Literature", "Historical", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "African American", "Africa", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Novels"], "isbn": "0440174643", "isbn13": "9780440174646", "publisher": "Dell Publishing", "author": ["Alex Haley"], "publishDate": 244537200000, "characters": ["Alex Haley", "Kunta Kinte", "George Lincoln Rockwell"], "places": ["Gambia", "The United States of America"], "ratingHistogram": [1300, 2565, 15232, 45544, 93871], "ratingsCount": 158512, "reviewsCount": 4140, "numPages": 888, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "ASJA Outstanding Book Award", "awardedAt": 252489600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Bancarella", "awardedAt": 252489600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 189331200000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lillian Smith Book Award", "awardedAt": 220953600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school.

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: \"Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally.\" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\"WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547467608i/17250.jpg", "genres": ["Literature", "High School", "Read For School", "Historical", "School", "Theatre", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Plays"], "asin": "0142437336", "isbn": "0142437336", "isbn13": "9780142437339", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["Arthur  Miller", "Christopher W.E.

And what is the true nature of evil?Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.An astonishingly rich re-creation of the land of Oz, this book retells the story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who wasn't so wicked after all.

As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.Powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal Japan, Sh\u014dgun is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book.

The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589i/2696.jpg", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Classic Literature", "Literature", "High School", "School", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Poetry", "Read For School"], "asin": "0140424385", "isbn": "0140424385", "isbn13": "9780140424386", "publisher": "Penguin Books/Penguin Classics", "author": ["Geoffrey Chaucer", "Nevill Coghill"], "publishDate": 1044345600000, "characters": ["The Wife of Bath"], "places": ["England"], "ratingHistogram": [9151, 25524, 70363, 67191, 44824], "ratingsCount": 217053, "reviewsCount": 4218, "numPages": 504, "language": "English"}

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631501298i/1898.jpg", "genres": ["Adventure", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Sports", "Memoir", "Travel", "History", "Mountaineering", "Survival", "Biography"], "publisher": "Anchor Books", "author": ["Jon Krakauer"], "publishDate": 940316400000, "characters": ["Jon Krakauer", "Rob Hall"], "places": ["Mount Everest", "Nepal"], "ratingHistogram": [9436, 13197, 62083, 173743, 229683], "ratingsCount": 488142, "reviewsCount": 17807, "numPages": 368, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 883641600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "ALA Alex Award", "awardedAt": 883641600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "awardedAt": 852105600000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Boardman Tasker Prize", "awardedAt": 852105600000, "category": "Mountain Literature", "hasWon": null}]}

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647i/8908.jpg", "genres": ["Post Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction", "War", "Zombies", "Fantasy", "Apocalyptic", "Dystopia", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Horror"], "asin": "0307346609", "isbn": "0307346609", "isbn13": "9780307346605", "publisher": "Crown", "series": ["World War Z"], "author": ["Max Brooks"], "publishDate": 1158044400000, "characters": ["Joe Muhammad", "Nury Televaldi", "Todd Wainio", "Jesika Hendricks", "Maria Zhuganova", "Kwang Jing-shu", "Zombies", "Stanley MacDonald"], "ratingHistogram": [11582, 28831, 97002, 177559, 197764], "ratingsCount": 512738, "reviewsCount": 29094, "numPages": 342, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "Multi-Voiced Performance", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Ignotus", "awardedAt": 1230796800000, "category": "Mejor novela extranjera (Best Foreign Novel)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lincoln Award", "awardedAt": 1325404800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Seiun Award \u661f\u96f2\u8cde", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Best Translated Long Form", "hasWon": null}]}

Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense.

The Lost Symbol is a masterstroke of storytelling - a deadly race through a real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths...all under the watchful eye of Brown's most terrifying villain to date. Set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, DC., The Lost Symbol accelerates through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale.As the story opens, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned unexpectedly to deliver an evening lecture in the U.S. Capitol Building. Within minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object - artfully encoded with five symbols - is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation...one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist - is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations - all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth.As the world discovered in The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histories, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes. In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent, lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "title": "Persuasion", "titleComplete": "Persuasion", "description": "Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413i/2156.jpg", "genres": ["Classic Literature", "Historical Romance", "Literature", "Classics", "Historical", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "19th Century", "Historical Fiction", "Romance"], "asin": "0192802631", "isbn": "0192802631", "isbn13": "9780192802637", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "author": ["Jane Austen", "Deidre Shauna Lynch", "\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043d \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d", "James Kinsley", "Richard Fadem"], "publishDate": 1072944000000, "characters": ["Mrs. Smith", "Penelope Clay", "Lady Russell", "Henrietta Musgrove", "Mary Musgrove", "Captain Harville", "William Elliot", "Sophia Croft", "Elizabeth Elliot", "Louisa Musgrove", "Anne Elliot", "Admiral Croft", "Captain James Benwick", "Charles Musgrove", "Sir Walter Elliot", "Captain Frederick Wentworth"], "places": ["Bath, Somerset, England", "Somerset, England", "United Kingdom", "Lyme Regis, England", "England"], "ratingHistogram": [11310, 25236, 114584, 224804, 299136], "ratingsCount": 675070, "reviewsCount": 30912, "numPages": 249, "language": "English"}

In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348577596i/14866.jpg", "genres": ["Chick Lit", "Crime", "Drama", "Contemporary", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Adult", "Realistic Fiction", "Mystery", "Adult Fiction"], "asin": "B001P5HDXG", "isbn": "0743496728", "isbn13": "9780743496728", "publisher": "Atria", "author": ["Jodi Picoult"], "publishDate": 1173081600000, "characters": ["Alex Cormier", "Lacy Houghton", "Jordan McAfee", "Lewis Houghton", "Peter Houghton", "Patrick Ducharme", "Josie Cormier"], "places": ["New Hampshire"], "ratingHistogram": [3921, 12111, 59244, 133160, 151562], "ratingsCount": 359998, "reviewsCount": 18679, "numPages": 440, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Iowa High School Book Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lincoln Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "LovelyBooks Leserpreis", "awardedAt": 1230796800000, "category": "Allgemeine Literatur", "hasWon": null}]}

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous \"White City\" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583433024i/397483.jpg", "genres": ["Crime", "Nonfiction", "Historical", "History", "American History", "Mystery", "Audiobook", "Book Club", "True Crime", "Biography"], "asin": "0609608444", "isbn": "0609608444", "isbn13": "9780609608449", "publisher": "Crown Publishers", "author": ["Erik Larson"], "publishDate": 1044950400000, "characters": ["Daniel Burnham", "H.H.

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant\u2019s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115i/8664353.jpg", "genres": ["War", "Nonfiction", "Military Fiction", "Biography Memoir", "World War II", "Memoir", "History", "Historical", "Audiobook", "Biography"], "asin": "1400064163", "isbn": "1400064163", "isbn13": "9781400064168", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["Laura Hillenbrand"], "publishDate": 1289894400000, "characters": ["Lynn Moody", "Anthony Zamperini", "Russell Allen Phillips", "William Harris", "Thorbj\u00f8rn Christiansen", "Yukichi Kano", "Harry Brooks", "Stanley Pillsbury", "Cecy Perry", "Francis McNamara (Mac)", "Pete Zamperini", "Louie Zamperini", "Sylvia Zamperini Flammer", "Virginia Zamperini", "Frank Tinker", "Cynthia Zamperini (Applewhite)", "Fred Garrett", "Payton Jordan", "Harry Read", "Louise Zamperini"], "ratingHistogram": [22558, 25132, 83271, 238194, 543987], "ratingsCount": 913142, "reviewsCount": 49694, "numPages": 475, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Los Angeles Times Book Prize", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Biography", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "Young Adults", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Indies Choice Book Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Dayton Literary Peace Prize", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lincoln Award", "awardedAt": 1420099200000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Andrew Carnegie Medal", "awardedAt": 1325404800000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "History and Biography", "hasWon": null}]}

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.The story is peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \"soul of pampered self-absorption\"; the uproarious black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427166915i/386187.jpg", "genres": ["Crime", "Nonfiction", "Southern", "Memoir", "Travel", "History", "Classics", "Mystery", "Audiobook", "True Crime"], "asin": "0679751521", "isbn": "0679751521", "isbn13": "9780679751526", "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["John Berendt"], "publishDate": 930553200000, "characters": ["Joe Odom", "Luther Driggers", "Mandy Nichols", "Serena Vaughn Dawes", "Johnny Mercer", "Lee Adler", "Conrad Aiken", "Chablis", "William Simon Glover", "Minerva", "Lucille Wright", "Jim Williams", "Danny Hansford", "Spencer Lawton Jr.", "Mary Harty", "Sonny Seiler", "Emma Kelly"], "places": ["Savannah, Georgia"], "ratingHistogram": [4063, 13692, 61400, 104968, 79835], "ratingsCount": 263958, "reviewsCount": 11750, "numPages": 386, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Pulitzer Prize", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "General Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Exclusive Books Boeke Prize", "awardedAt": 788947200000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Ferro-Grumley Award", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Gay Fiction (Non-Fiction)", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lambda Literary Award", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Gay Mystery", "hasWon": null}]}

It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434i/11989.jpg", "genres": ["Novels", "Philosophy", "20th Century", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Fiction", "French Literature", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "France"], "publisher": "Vintage International", "author": ["Albert Camus", "Stuart Gilbert"], "publishDate": 667814400000, "characters": ["Asthma Patient", "Father Paneloux", "Raoul", "Mme.

One of the results of its publication in the West was Pasternak's complete rejection by Soviet authorities; when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958 he was compelled to decline it. The book quickly became an international best-seller.Dr. Yury Zhivago, Pasternak's alter ego, is a poet, philosopher, and physician whose life is disrupted by the war and by his love for Lara, the wife of a revolutionary. His artistic nature makes him vulnerable to the brutality and harshness of the Bolsheviks.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas", "title": "Cloud Atlas", "titleComplete": "Cloud Atlas", "description": "A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852i/49628.jpg", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Contemporary", "Dystopia", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Novels"], "isbn": "0375507256", "isbn13": "9780375507250", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["David Mitchell"], "publishDate": 1092726000000, "characters": ["Sonmi~451", "Javier Gomez", "Zachry", "Nurse Noakes", "Isaac Sachs", "Old Georgie", "Vyvyan Ayrs", "Fay Li", "Joe Napier", "Yoona-939", "Robert Frobisher", "Bill Smoke", "Hae-Joo Im", "Rufus Sixsmith", "Meronym", "Ernie Blacksmith", "Autua", "Adam Ewing", "Luisa Rey", "Dr. Goose", "Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck", "Mr. Meeks", "Jocasta Ayrs", "Timothy Cavendish"], "places": ["South Korea", "Buenas Yerbas", "London, England", "The United States of America", "Maui, Hawaii", "Seoul, South Korea", "Chatham Islands", "Belgium", "England", "Neerbeke, West Vlaanderen"], "ratingHistogram": [7749, 15341, 41264, 83426, 97037], "ratingsCount": 244817, "reviewsCount": 21643, "numPages": 509, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Best SF Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Arthur C.

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0629) or Medinan (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0629) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation.

The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1275263838i/646462.jpg", "genres": ["Mythology", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Islam", "Spirituality", "Religion", "History", "Reference", "Classics", "Theology"], "author": ["Ya\u015far Nuri \u00d6zt\u00fcrk", "Anonymous"], "publishDate": -41655139200000, "characters": ["Jesus", "Abraham (Bible)", "Mary (mother of Jesus)", "Moses", "Adam (Bible)"], "places": ["Mekka and Madina"], "ratingHistogram": [4316, 2852, 5051, 5152, 49329], "ratingsCount": 66700, "reviewsCount": 3609, "numPages": 604, "language": "Arabic"}

In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication.

Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work \"quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H.

Set in the rich farmland of California\u2019s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families\u2014the Trasks and the Hamiltons\u2014whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1639969375i/4406.jpg", "genres": ["20th Century", "Classic Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "Historical", "Fiction", "American", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Novels"], "asin": "0142000655", "isbn": "0142000655", "isbn13": "9780142000656", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["John Steinbeck"], "publishDate": 1009872000000, "characters": ["Olive Hamilton", "Charles Trask", "Will Hamilton", "Cyrus Trask", "Samuel Hamilton", "Liza Hamilton", "Dessie Hamilton", "Aron Trask", "Cathy Ames", "Caleb Trask", "Tom Hamilton", "Joe Valery", "Abra Bacon", "Adam Trask", "Lee"], "places": ["California", "Salinas Valley, California", "The United States of America"], "ratingHistogram": [5796, 12897, 53213, 141311, 307253], "ratingsCount": 520470, "reviewsCount": 27562, "numPages": 601, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "Classic", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Deutscher H\u00f6rbuchpreis", "awardedAt": 1641024000000, "category": "Bestes H\u00f6rspiel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "National Book Award Finalist", "awardedAt": -536428800000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346267826i/40440.jpg", "genres": ["Book Club", "Mystery Thriller", "Fantasy", "Gothic", "Historical", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Adult", "Books About Books", "Historical Fiction"], "asin": "0743298020", "isbn": "0743298020", "isbn13": "9780743298025", "publisher": "Atria Books", "author": ["Diane Setterfield"], "publishDate": 1158044400000, "characters": ["Vida Winter", "Aurelius Love", "Margaret Lea", "Adeline March", "Emmeline March"], "places": ["Angelfield"], "ratingHistogram": [6147, 16515, 63555, 115519, 107168], "ratingsCount": 308904, "reviewsCount": 26206, "numPages": 406, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Dilys Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "ALA Alex Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "The Quill Award", "awardedAt": 1167638400000, "category": "Debut Author of the year", "hasWon": null}]}

The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463702268i/30236962.jpg", "genres": ["Fantasy", "Gothic", "Historical", "Vampires", "Paranormal", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Horror", "Historical Fiction", "Thriller"], "asin": "B000FCK6EI", "publisher": " Little, Brown and Company", "author": ["Elizabeth Kostova"], "publishDate": 1462086000000, "characters": ["Stephen Barley", "Bartholomew Rossi", "Helen Rossi", "Ev\u00e1 Orb\u00e1n", "Anton Stoichev", "____ Getzi", "Paul Ross", "Turgut Bora", "Vlad III", "Hugh James"], "places": ["Istanbul", "Turkey", "Oxford University, Oxford, England", "Amsterdam", "Hungary", "Netherlands", "England", "Budapest"], "ratingHistogram": [10549, 22856, 59350, 86708, 82864], "ratingsCount": 262327, "reviewsCount": 17960, "numPages": 704, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "International Horror Guild Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Hopwood Award", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "Novel in-progress", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Book Sense Book of the Year Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Best Adult Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "The Quill Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Debut Author of the Year", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lord Ruthven Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition.

For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659905828i/7235533.jpg", "genres": ["Epic", "Magic", "Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Adult", "High Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy"], "asin": "0765326353", "isbn": "0765326353", "isbn13": "9780765326355", "publisher": "Tor Books", "series": ["The Stormlight Archive", "The Cosmere"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"], "publishDate": 1283238000000, "characters": ["Renarin Kholin", "Jasnah Kholin", "Dalinar Kholin", "Kaladin Stormblessed", "Sylphrena", "Shallan Davar", "Adolin Kholin", "Hoid"], "places": ["Roshar"], "ratingHistogram": [3389, 5126, 19907, 88819, 339025], "ratingsCount": 456266, "reviewsCount": 32262, "numPages": 1007, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Best Fantasy Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "David Gemmell Legend Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Whitney Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Best Novel of the Year", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author", "hasWon": null}]}

United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives \u2013 until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts. With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters.

Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want\u2014a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world\u2014all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way\u2014unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society\u2019s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414i/19501.jpg", "genres": ["Chick Lit", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Memoir", "Travel", "Spirituality", "Contemporary", "Autobiography", "Romance", "Biography"], "asin": "0143038419", "isbn": "0143038419", "isbn13": "9780143038412", "publisher": "Riverhead Books", "author": ["Elizabeth Gilbert"], "publishDate": 1170144000000, "characters": ["Richard from Texas", "Wayan", "Liz Gilbert", "Felipe"], "places": ["Indonesia", "Southeast Asia", "Rome", "India", "Ubud, Bali", "Italy", "Bali", "New York City, New York"], "ratingHistogram": [121204, 186480, 417164, 478193, 501370], "ratingsCount": 1704411, "reviewsCount": 57686, "numPages": 368, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Puddly Award", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\"Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His \"wonderful, awful\" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

It begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867i/3412.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Romance", "Drama", "Classics", "Historical", "Australia", "Fiction", "Adult", "Historical Fiction", "Romance", "Novels"], "publisher": "Avon Books", "author": ["Colleen McCullough"], "publishDate": 1009872000000, "characters": ["Luddie Mueller", "Stuart \"Stu\" Cleary", "Francis \"Frank\" Cleary", "Luke O'Neill", "Rainer \"Rain\" Moerling Hartheim", "James and Patrick \"Jims and Patsy\" Cleary", "Dane O'Neill", "Bob Cleary", "Mary Elizabeth Cleary Carson", "Meghann \"Meggie\" Cleary", "Ralph de Bricassart", "Justine O'Neill", "Jack Cleary", "Archbishop (later Cardinal) Vittorio di Contini-Verchese", "Padraic \"Paddy\" Cleary", "Harold \"Hal\" Cleary", "Fiona \"Fee\" Cleary", "Anne Mueller", "Hughie Cleary"], "places": ["New Zealand", "Outback", "Australia", "Vatican City"], "ratingHistogram": [4039, 11427, 51291, 108794, 169600], "ratingsCount": 345151, "reviewsCount": 7645, "numPages": 692, "language": "English"}

Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories.

The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \"lickings\" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn \u00ad the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \"tattle-tale.\"  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \"engaged\" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:\"TOM!\" No answer. \"TOM!\" No answer. \"What's gone with that boy, \u00a0I wonder?

She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: \"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll\u2014\" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with.

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.\" With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing\u2014though absurdly comic\u2014meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even \"settle down\" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642i/43763.jpg", "genres": ["Supernatural", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Gothic", "Vampires", "Urban Fantasy", "Fiction", "Horror", "Historical Fiction", "Classics"], "asin": "0345476875", "isbn": "0345476875", "isbn13": "9780345476876", "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "series": ["The Vampire Chronicles"], "author": ["Anne Rice"], "publishDate": 1093935600000, "characters": ["Claudia", "Louis de Pointe du Lac", "Lestat de Lioncourt", "Daniel Molloy"], "places": ["New Orleans, Louisiana", "Paris", "Louisiana"], "ratingHistogram": [10746, 30558, 115427, 196976, 217828], "ratingsCount": 571535, "reviewsCount": 15190, "numPages": 346, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "British Fantasy Award", "awardedAt": 220953600000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy\u2014exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling\u2014does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors\u2014yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age 13 she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate\u2014a life and a role that she has never challenged ... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister\u2014and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart or let others lead you?

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg", "genres": ["British Literature", "Fantasy", "Medieval", "Historical", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Adult", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Novels"], "publisher": "NAL Trade", "series": ["Kingsbridge"], "author": ["Ken Follett"], "publishDate": 1012809600000, "characters": ["Tom Builder", "Prior Philip", "Richard of Kingsbridge", "Stephen of England", "Ellen", "Henry II of England", "Lady Regan Hamleigh", "Lord Percy Hamleigh", "Jack Jackson", "Empress Matilda", "Aliena", "Alfred Builder", "Remigius", "Thomas Becket", "Waleran Bigod", "William Hamleigh"], "places": ["England"], "ratingHistogram": [13136, 23159, 79530, 215416, 414429], "ratingsCount": 745670, "reviewsCount": 36532, "numPages": 976, "language": "English"}

But his real problem is not the enemy\u2014it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he\u2019s assigned, he\u2019ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller\u2019s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller\u2019s personal archive; and much more.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440319389i/4981.jpg", "genres": ["War", "Science Fiction", "Time Travel", "Literature", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "American", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Novels"], "asin": "0385333846", "isbn": "0385333846", "isbn13": "9780385333849", "publisher": "Dial Press", "author": ["Kurt Vonnegut Jr."], "publishDate": 916128000000, "characters": ["Valencia Merble", "Barbara Pilgrim", "Paul Lazzaro", "Robert Pilgrim", "Howard W.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Soon afterwards, various bizarre incidents unfold in England: an apparently unmanned ship is wrecked off the coast of Whitby; a young woman discovers strange puncture marks on her neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the 'Master' and his imminent arrival.In Dracula, Bram Stoker created one of the great masterpieces of the horror genre, brilliantly evoking a nightmare world of vampires and vampire hunters and also illuminating the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.This Norton Critical Edition includes a rich selection of background and source materials in three areas: Contexts includes probable inspirations for Dracula in the earlier works of James Malcolm Rymer and Emily Gerard. Also included are a discussion of Stoker's working notes for the novel and \"Dracula's Guest,\" the original opening chapter to Dracula. Reviews and Reactions reprints five early reviews of the novel. \"Dramatic and Film Variations\" focuses on theater and film adaptations of Dracula, two indications of the novel's unwavering appeal. David J. Skal, Gregory A. Waller, and Nina Auerbach offer their varied perspectives. Checklists of both dramatic and film adaptations are included.Criticism collects seven theoretical interpretations of Dracula by Phyllis A. Roth, Carol A. Senf, Franco Moretti, Christopher Craft, Bram Dijkstra, Stephen D.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg", "genres": ["Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "War", "Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Dystopia", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Classics"], "asin": "0812550706", "isbn": "0812550706", "isbn13": "9780812550702", "publisher": "Tor", "series": ["Enderverse:  Publication Order", "Ender's Saga", "The Enderverse"], "author": ["Orson Scott Card"], "publishDate": 1096527600000, "characters": ["Mazer Rackham", "Peter Wiggin", "Petra Arkanian", "Major Imbu", "Bonzo", "Bernard", "Andrew Wiggin", "Alai", "Dink", "Hyrum Graff", "Valentine Wiggin", "Major Anderson", "\"Bean\""], "places": ["Outer Space"], "ratingHistogram": [23104, 41400, 155468, 400987, 718506], "ratingsCount": 1339465, "reviewsCount": 48650, "numPages": 324, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 504950400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 473414400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Ignotus", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Mejor Cuento Extranjero", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premi Ictineu", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "Millor novel\u00b7la tradu\u00efda", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.
